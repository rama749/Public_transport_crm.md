# üöç Public Transport CRM Project

## 1. Problem Statement
Public transport systems in many cities face challenges such as:
- Delayed buses/trains with no real-time updates to passengers.
- Difficulty in handling complaints (lost items, refunds, feedback).
- Lack of personalized communication channels.
- Manual complaint handling leading to delays.

This creates frustration among passengers and reduces trust in public services.
A CRM solution can centralize customer interactions, automate issue resolution, and provide data-driven insights.
